# CanHaptics Lab 2
### Author: Bradley Rey

This lab was designed to have us familiarize ourselves with the Haply device that we will be using throughout this course. From initial setup, running examples, and finally creating our own _maze_, this lab provided the basics to get started with the Haply virtual environment and hardware.

## Initial Setup and Examples
### Setup
The initial setup was relatively straight forward. I have used Arduino boards and Processing before, so the environment was familiar. The hardware build process also was easy with the accompanying video. Through the process, I did come across some minor firmware/software issues which did not take long to fix; however, most of these came from oversight and me rushing through steps in the documentation!

The one main problem I faced during setup was in regards to the motors activating rapidly and holding the pantograph in a specific position and vibrating violently. This seemingly happened at random when I would run a sketch. I now believe the cause was I that was turning on the Haply after the sketch had begun running. I had been doing this as I was unaware of the relative positioning, something Oliver mentioned in a later class, which was affecting my ability to move throughout the entire sketch. It seemed that by me turning the Haply on and off at different times, the Haply was saving its last known position. Then when turned on again it would revert back to that position, hold, and shake. All-in-all, I quickly overcame this issue by simply leaving the Haply device on at all times and reverting to the _home_ position after closing each sketch.

### Examples

With the setup complete and the Haply device working fine, I was able to test the Hello Wall sketch along with the other examples on Haplyâ€™s site! I explored the feeling of the force feedback for the first time, and had my roommates try it out as well (who both that it was cool). The force feedback provided was definitely unique. I wasnâ€™t expecting to experience as much force as I did, and in fact had to hold the Haply device with my other hand so as not to have it slide on my desk when pushing against a wall. It is a cool experience tying something thatâ€™s visual and realistic to a haptic device which provides the expected feedback. Overall, these initial examples made me excited to dive into the building of a maze as well as the course project!

## My Maze
### Introduction
For my maze, I mainly modified the [maze example](https://2diy.haply.co/) published by Haply. This allowed me to explore the [Fisica package](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/reference/index.html) and some of the capabilities of the Haply virtual environment. In the online example, I first explored things like `setDamping`, the amount of gravity, `setDensity`, and `setRestitution` to see how they affected the actions of the objects and the world.

In regards to my maze, I first sketched a proposed maze on paper. My goal was to create a _scene_, which would require the user to get a ball to an end goal, while using other objects to help. Furthermore, I added resets in places which when touched would restart the maze. The scene took the form of an ocean with a sailboat and rocks, a beach with some sandcastles, and space with some satellites (Iâ€™m seeing a theme from Lab1 and Lab2, and think Iâ€™m looking forward to travelling somewhere warm when I can ðŸ˜‚)! The sketch and corresponding final virtual environment can be seen below.

### Creation
After sketching my idea, I created the scene using `FBox` to create the individual elements. I then began to explore the haptics. 

I wanted to create a stronger feeling of water from Haplyâ€™s maze example and thus increased the `setDamping = 825` when my avatar was inside the water. This provides a very slow feeling; I was surprised at how much it felt, and looked, like I was moving through water! I also played around with buoyancy levels for each of the game objects. This allowed me to create one object that was quite buoyant, similar to a basketball, while one was neutrally buoyant and could float around within the water, similar to a light metal pole.

For the sand, I created a weighted and slowed feeling for objects being pushed across it. This was too mimic a heavy object being pushed across sand which is inherently difficult due to sandâ€™s properties. I attempted to explore `setFriction`, which I thought was a natural attribute to set, however had no luck at obtaining any feel from this. Ultimately, I used `setDamping = 50` and `setDensity = 15` too create a weighted and tough to move feeling.

Next, I created the haptics for the space section of the maze. For this, it was counter to the water in which I actually wanted to create no damping effect, friction, or feeling of weight. My thought was that  after creating haptic sensations throughout the maze, the use of no haptic force feedback was a sensation in itself! I used similar methods to that of the buoyancy code which adds a force using 	`addForce()` and set `setDensity = 1`, `setDamping = 1`, and `setRestitution = -100`. Getting the force correct was tricky, which took trial and error. However, restitution was the setting that really allowed it to feel like space, where in, a small tap would _gently_ nudge the object rather than have it rocket away.

After the setup, and some testing of individual elements throughout, I added my maze resets and the end goal flag. You can see the red resets in action below, which activate when a blue game object touches them.

I then began to test the maze. Through this testing I came across an issue that I ultimately could not resolve. When the two game objects, the blue wall and ball, were out of the water and touching each other the wall would shake rapidly (see the gifs below) and sometimes fly off. I assume this is due to forces acting on each object when they are in contact. I tried many things to stop this force, such as using `resetForces()` when they were in contact, reducing the restitution and even making one object static using `setStatic(true)` while they were in contact. None of these resolved the issue, which I would like to further explore, so I created a work around with a second wall.

### Improvements
On my own time, I want to continue working with this example as I feel it is a great learning experience. One aspect of this is to create a fully realistic zero gravity environment. Ultimately, my space area still has some gravitational pull. This worked out as a benefit to help the user keep the ball in space and maneuver it around the satellites, however it is not realistic to space. A second area that I would like to explore is using and creating the feel of friction, especially on the sand. I feel that the haptics and visual experiences could be improved in these areas.

### Solution
If you want to try my maze, which admittedly you may come across a bug or two as this was a quick implementation given the time for the lab, you can find the .pde sketch [here](https://github.com/bradleyrrr/bradleyrrr.github.io/blob/gh-pages/lab2_sketch.pde).

**MAZE SPOILER**
After final setup and some more minor tweaks, I was able to complete the maze by getting the blue ball to the green flag! There are two possible ways a user can do this. First, they can go through the water. This requires using the wall in the water to setup a path for the ball to get out. Then, the user must lift up the bridge that has fallen at the sand castles, before moving the ball up and across to the flag.

The second solution involves the space element. Here, users can lift the ball out of the water and up the mast fo the sail boat. Then upon entering space, they must carefully maneuver the ball around the satellites before dropping it down onto the flag; see the second gif below.

## Conclusion
This lab was a great introduction to the Haply device and its virtual environment. Through the use of examples from Haply and the Fisica package I got to experience force feedback for the first time! This lab provided some great initial exploration into the mechanics at play and I am looking forward to continuing to improve upon them throughout the course.
