# CanHaptics Lab 1
### Author: Bradley Rey

This lab was designed to have us familiarize ourselves with DIY sketching and prototyping. I found this exercise to be quite different from anything I have done in a while, and as such a very useful experience. It did take me a while to _get going_, but once I had one sketch under my belt the others were easier to design!

In order to accomplish this lab, I first put together many different items from around my house that I thought could be useful. Many of which were incorporated within the sketches you will see below. I had all these items laid out and subsequently _played_ with each to try to visualize and feel how an item might be used. From there I would do some paper sketches to try and formalize an idea. These often were iterated, sometimes not even resembling the original idea. Each sketch in this post can be categorized under Moussette‚Äôs levels of sketching as taking minutes/hours.

I hope you enjoy the sketches I demonstrate below, and feel free to comment or provide feedback on the sketch or process of design at the bottom of the page!



## 1mm Sketch: Rubber Band Trampoline

So I recently needed about three rubber bands for a Christmas gift I was making for someone. Of course, I could only buy a bag that will last me a life-time üòÇ With the elastic property that a rubber band has, and its ability to store energy that can be released, I knew I wanted to involve the many rubber bands I had in a sketch.

My initial thought was to use the elastic band to _shoot_ something. However, I also liked the idea of bouncing something to create movement. I had a little tray that I could use to wrap rubber bands around. This provided me with a small trampoline like prototype. From there, I tested the movement. First, I explored dropping a light ball onto the trampoline. Here, I also noticed that the bounce created a rather fun sound, and if I held the edge of the tray I could feel vibrations each time the ball bounced. 

Next, I then placed the ball on top of my created trampoline and placed a glass around the ball. By tapping on top of the glass, I could create a bounce effect that caused both the rubber bands and ball to move within a few millimetres.

However, as I felt that this was human actuated I wanted to create a sketch that could have the ball make its way to the trampoline and bounce on its own. Thus, using a measuring tape as a ramp, in order to transmit energy, I released the ball from a higher position than the trampoline. I outfitted the trampoline with walls to contain the ball when it was dropped from the top of the measuring tape. This worked well and allowed for millimetre movement of the rubber bands, as well many small millimetre bounces of the ball towards the end of the motion.

## 10mm Sketch: So Close Yet So Far
Imagine you‚Äôve been lost at sea for days, maybe weeks, or even months (it‚Äôs hard to keep track) ü§™ Whatever day it is‚Ä¶.you finally see land in the distance! However, just as you are heading towards land, the wind starts to pick up and the waves get pretty choppy üåä You‚Äôre so close. You can almost feel the sand in your feet‚Ä¶üèù‚Ä¶

Unfortunately as you‚Äôll see in this sketch, the story does not have a happy ending, (unless you‚Äôre a CanHaptics student who created a sketch for your lab)!

Magnets are fun. For that simple reason, I wanted to incorporate some neodymium magnets I had lying around.

This sketch took me a while, as initially I was trying to create movement using the polarities of the magnets (see below). However, when trying to force similar polarities together, I found it very difficult to contain the magnets from flipping and attracting. Lots of tape, time, and so many other odd bits were used to try and create interesting movement.

Finally, the idea came into my mind to use a different source of movement throughout the sketch, and have the magnets solely provide the 10 millimetre movement desired. Using the magnets, an aluminium foil boat, a baking dish with some blue gatorade/water, and a fan I created the little story mentioned above.

In this sketch, the majority of the magnets, which have potential energy in a magnetized state, were placed under the dish holding the water. I then placed one magnet inside my boat. Using the fan to transmit energy, the boat could move across the water. I aimed for the boat to head towards land (ü™¥ü™¥). When the magnets came near each other, the potential energy translated into kinetic energy which caused the boat to sink roughly 10-20 millimetres!

## 100mmm Sketch: The Sneezer
This last sketch was born from two items I had initially pooled together when brainstorming ideas. First, I had grabbed a mask which I had  near my front door (which inspired the idea, but was not used). Second, I had a spray bottle which we often use to mist some of our plants. The idea I had was to trigger the bottle to spray water 100 millimetres, acting as a sneeze. Unfortunately this sketch did not work 100%, which I will describe below, however it was a great learning expereince and with some modification I believe it could work perfectly.

I quickly realized that the spray bottle I had would require too much force to pull the trigger. I tried many different things, even using my drill. However, I could not get a working mechanism and as such, opted for a easier to actuate hair spray bottle. I first tested the ability for an object to be dropped on top of the bottle to trigger the spraying of water inside. From my tests, I could get the bottle to spray when a hockey puck was dropped from about 600 millimetres above the bottle.

Next, I created my sketch. This included creating towers which would allow for my to place the puck at the required height, resting on Kleenex taped to the towers. The spray bottle was placed underneath, and aimed at my unsuspecting sneeze victim 100 millimetres away from the bottle. Lastly, as a way to trigger the sketch, I used a kettle and mores specifically boiling water and its produced steam. Here, the steam would cause the strength of the Kleenex to weaken, and as such the heavy hockey puck could then fall through making contact with the actuator of the hair spray bottle.

After many attempts, I realized this was not going to completely work. When the hockey puck would finally brake through the Kleenex, its trajectory would not be a straight decent. As such, I never got perfect contact. In order to for the sketch to work, I did need to drop the puck using my hand. The results on my sneeze victim can be seen below.

As this sketch did not fully work without me releasing the puck manually, I sketched on paper a modification that I believe would make the hardware sketch work as designed. Below, the sketch details a system that would contain a heavy metal ball. By containing the ball using a paper towel roll, the ball could properly fall onto the hair spray bottle‚Äôs actuator.

## Conclusion
Through many iterations on sketches, I was able to produce the three sketches defined within this lab post. Each provides a quick iterative process using Moussette‚Äôs lowest level of sketching. Throughout the course, and more specifically the project, I look forward to further exploring the more defined levels.

By creating these three sketches/prototypes, I was introduced to many challenges and yet a fun experience. Using day-to-day objects around me to create movement, and in some cases a tactile sensation, allowed me to think outside the box and in ways I don‚Äôt often spend time on. This type of low level design and quick sketching is something I look forward to using more of throughout my HCI career!
