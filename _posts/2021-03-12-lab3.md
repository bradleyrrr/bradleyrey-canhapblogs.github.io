# CanHaptics Lab 3
### Author: Bradley Rey

## Overview
The final lab for the course involves communicating something via haptics and the Haply device. Haptics, while not often used to convey or communicate complex emotions or feedback, can still be used effectively. Through the use of force feedback and motion control on the Haply, this lab will explore just that. We aim to convey a small set of words through a vocabulary of communicative movements. This communication will only be given through the Haply, thus no visual or audio cues are shown.

## Words and Motivation
The three words (phrases) that we intend to convey are “_nervous excitement, suspenseful tension, and scared_. These words, and the idea behind creating this set came from a haunted house. If you’ve ever been to a haunted house, and are one to get scared, this may resonate with you.

Whether you understand the metaphor or not, I will lead with an example to set the scene.

Imagine you arrive to a haunted house with some friends. Initially you feel safe as you have merely arrived and are not about to step foot in the house. However, after you pay you make your way to the line. As that line starts to move and you get closer to the entrance, safety takes way of nervous excitement. You start to bounce around, talk to yourself, and maybe make jokes to lighten the nerves.

Finally, the time has come to go into the house. You and your friends make your way inside with a focus on caution. As you make your way further into the house, you know something is coming but you don’t know when and where. This causes you to move with even more caution as you go deeper and deeper into the depths of the house.

Finally, out of nowhere something jumps out at you! You scream! You run! You go anywhere that isn’t right there.

And after all that, for some reason we choose to keep going back year after year!

## Implementation
### Overview and Idea
In order to implement and communicate the feelings mentioned above we first sketched the _scene_ we felt could convey this. 

![sketch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradleyrrr/bradleyrrr.github.io/gh-pages/assets/img/sketch.png)

As we were to use at least two methods, I focused on including the following:
1. Static (non-moving) objects
2. Regions with different dynamics (dampening)
3. Motion guidance of the end effector

The static objects are used in the first part of the communication, that of _nervous excitement_. Here, the idea is that movement will become jerky and interrupted, simulating a bouncing around of sorts.

Regions with different dynamics are used to build the _suspense and tension_ as you move closer to the scary object. Through dampening, the end effector gets much more difficult to move and moves at a slower pace. This simulates the idea that tension and suspense are building up.

Lastly, by moving the end effector, we aim to create the _scared_ which often leads to us running away, assuming the flight response beats the fight response! Here, upon touching the scary object the end effector will shoot back to safety; almost as if you are running for your life!

### Code
In order to accomplish the three sections mentioned above we wrote code to create the objects and areas within the world as well as to move the end effector.

First, for the _nervous excitement_, we have the world built with 70 random boxes. This allows for a jittery and abrupt feel when trying to move through them.

```
for (int i=0; i<70; i++) {
    FBox temp = new FBox (random(0.5, worldWidth/32), random(0.5, worldHeight/32));
    temp.setPosition(random(worldWidth/8,worldWidth/2.5), random(0,worldHeight));
    temp.setFill(0);
    temp.setStatic(true);
    world.add(temp);
  }
```

Second, we create the dampened areas. This uses stronger levels of dampening as the end effector gets closer to the scary object. When not in this section of the sketch, the user can move quite freely in comparison.

```
if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp1))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(900);  
    else if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp2))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(950); 
    else if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp3))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(975);    
    else if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp4))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(990);
    else 
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(50);
```

Finally, upon touching the scary object the user is moved back to the start position, which can be deemed safe. The code recognizes the touch and then forces the end effector back across to the left side. This is done in a rapid (but stable) motion so as to simulate a quick escape.

```
if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(scaredBox)) {
        gameStart = false;
        moveAvatar();
    }

void moveAvatar() {

}
```

Overall, the graphics look like this which helps get an idea of the sketch that a user would be blindly working through. Here you can visually see the many aspects of this sketch.

The safe area is to the left of the leftmost black bar. This area has no haptic feedback. The _nervous excitement_ area can be seen next, which has blocks scattered across. The dampened area can be seen, where an increased dampening value corresponds with a darker hue of blue. Lastly, the scary rectangle on the right is what a user touches for the end effector to move back to safety.
